## Capstone 325: Tax Tavern - A Tax Preparation Company Site

MERN Stack final capstone project for Per Scholas' 2025 RTT-48: Full Stack Development Course. 

A culmination of all that I learned through the course, Tax Dynasty is a mock, tax-preparation company site with a working backend, frontend interface with account creation and password encryption. The Live Site and Server are available on Render.
